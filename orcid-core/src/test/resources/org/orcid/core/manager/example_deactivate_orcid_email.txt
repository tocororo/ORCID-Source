Dear Josiah Carberry,

You have requested that your ORCID Account associated with ORCID ID 4444-4444-4444-4446 be deactivated.
Please click on the following link to complete the deactivation process:

http://testserver.orcid.org/account/confirm-deactivate-orcid

So as not to assign the same identifier to another person, ORCID will maintain in a private data
file your ORCID ID, name, and email address; all other data in your record will be removed.
You may contact ORCID if you later wish to re-claim your identifier and reactivate your account. 

If you did not request account deactivation, please contact the ORCID Help Desk at 
https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/requests/new. 

Kind Regards,
The ORCID Team
