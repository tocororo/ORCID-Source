email.march_2019.subject=Add a backup email to your ORCID account!
email.march_2019.paragraph_1=The number one reason why ORCID users contact us is because they’re unable to access their ORCID record -- and the number one reason why, is because they only have one email address connected with their account, and they’ve lost access to it.
email.march_2019.paragraph_2=Make sure this doesn’t happen to you - add one or more backup emails to your account now! It only takes a couple of minutes, and will ensure that, even if you move organizations, you can still access your account and, if needed, easily reset your password (another top reason why users contact us).

email.march_2019.paragraph_3.part_5=for more information.
email.march_2019.paragraph_4.part_1=If you haven’t already done so, we strongly recommend that you add your personal email to your ORCID account because -- unlike a work email --  it’s unlikely that you will lose access to this.  The default visibility setting for emails is private (Only Me), meaning that ORCID will not share this information with other parties.  You can use your
