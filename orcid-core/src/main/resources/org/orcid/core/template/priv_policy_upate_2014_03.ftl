Dear ${emailName},

Privacy is a fundamental concern for ORCID. We have completed a rigorous and 
comprehensive privacy certification with TRUSTe. This process includes a check 
of our policies, a review of how we communicate our handling of data and 
privacy, and a review of our dispute procedures.

Not surprisingly, we found out that our privacy policy was in great shape! We 
also took this opportunity to make the policy itself clearer and easier to 
read. You can read more on our blog [1]. Here are some highlights:

* Clearer privacy setting information. 
  We simplified the language to describe the privacy settings that researchers 
  can control, including images of the privacy controls.

* Control the use of your information. 
  We provide more detail about how we use the information we collect, and how 
  to manage your inclusion or exclusion in those uses.

* Details about commercial access. 
  We clarify our strong controls over how commercial entities can use your data 
  and provide more details about how you can control such use.

* Managing your ORCID data even when you no longer can. 
  We now include information about how records are managed once someone is 
  deceased.

* Addressing issues when all else fails. 
  We now provide more detail about what we do when errors are found, including 
  our dispute procedure.
